# SQL-Project7
I started by creating a sample Employees table with some data, including a sensitive Salary column.
To practice security and abstraction, I then created a VIEW that hides the salary and only shows employees from one department.
In the .sql file, you can see the code for the table, the view, and the final SELECT query I used to check my work
